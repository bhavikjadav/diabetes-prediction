Description:

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 

The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, 
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. 

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. 

In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
